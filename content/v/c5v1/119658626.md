    "description": "An introduction to the armour worn by the Adeptus Astartes, from power armour to storm shields. Apologies for the poor audio volume in the middle. Unfortunately it was an issue on recording. I will be upgrading recording equipment soon, so hopefully this won't be an issue in future. For now I recorded audio all the way up. If you have a sub-woofer now is the time to use it...\n\nIntro Music: \nDaniel Yount - Dark Times\n\nThe Legal Notice: \nAll works used in this video (Images, audio etc) belong to their respective authors, Vaults of Terra hold No propriety interest, either wholly or in part, in any of the work displayed here (This statement does not include the audio recorded by the Vaults of Terra). \n\nGames workshop, Warhammer 40,000, Warhammer, 40k, Space Marine Etc are all Trademarks of Games Workshop Ltd.
