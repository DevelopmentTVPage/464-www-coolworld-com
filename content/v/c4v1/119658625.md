Guess what I asked from the chaos gods for Christmas? \n\nIntro Music: \nDaniel Yount - Dark Times\n\nThe Legal Notice: \nAll works used in this video (Images, audio etc) belong to their respective authors, Vaults of Terra hold No propriety interest, either wholly or in part, in any of the work displayed here (This statement does not include the audio recorded by the Vaults of Terra). \n\nGames workshop, Warhammer 40,000, Warhammer, 40k, Space Marine Etc are all Trademarks of Games Workshop Ltd.
