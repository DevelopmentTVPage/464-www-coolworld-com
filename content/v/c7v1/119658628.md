    "description": "The first Space Marine tech video detailing the range weaponry used by the super soldiers of the Imperium. This was going to include the close combat weaponry as well, but even I felt sleepy after all of that, so the next installment in the Space Marines series will be the Close combat Armory followed by the armor, vehicles and equipment videos, broken down into shorter, non sleep inducing videos. Glory be to Khorne... err the Emperor.\n-\n-\n*Oops*\n\nIntro Music: \nDaniel Yount - Dark Times\n\nThe Legal Notice: \nAll works used in this video (Images, audio etc) belong to their respective authors, Vaults of Terra hold No propriety interest, either wholly or in part, in any of the work displayed here (This statement does not include the audio recorded by the Vaults of Terra). \n\nGames workshop, Warhammer 40,000, Warhammer, 40k, Space Marine Etc are all Trademarks of Games Workshop Ltd.
